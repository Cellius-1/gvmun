                <h2>Historical context of NATO-Russia relations</h2>
                
                <h3>NATO-USSR relations</h3>
                <p>
                    Relations between Russia and NATO have a long and complicated history, dating back to 1949, the year NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) was founded. This military-political alliance was created to protect European countries from a potential threat from the Soviet Union, which largely determined the nature of interaction between the parties for decades to come. At that time, 12 countries became NATO member states: the United States, Canada, Iceland, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Italy and Portugal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Cold War, the USSR and NATO were in open conflict. Moscow, in opposition to the North Atlantic Alliance, created the Warsaw Pact on May 14, 1955, which united the countries of the socialist bloc into a military alliance. Meanwhile, NATO continued to expand: it was joined by West Germany, Greece, and Turkey in the 1960s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the restraint and conservatism of Soviet foreign policy at that time, it was under Gromyko (1909-1989) that the period of détente began – a gradual easing of tensions between the USSR and the USA. The USSR's relations with other European countries also improved. One striking example was France's move: in 1966, it withdrew from NATO military structures. The final stage of the détente policy was the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), held between July 3 and August 1, 1975 in Helsinki.
                </p>

                <h3>NATO-Russia relations in the 2000s</h3>
                <p>
                    After the collapse of the USSR on December 20, 1991, Russia became one of the founders of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), created as a platform for political dialogue between NATO and the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, as well as the Baltic and CIS states. On May 30, 1992, this body was transformed into the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the previous system of international alliances, NATO began to actively expand to the east, which led to the emergence of new "border" states of allies on Russia's borders. This caused alarm in Moscow, especially when Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, countries that had previously been members of the Warsaw Pact, declared their desire to join the Alliance in 1992–1993.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1996, when it became clear that the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO was inevitable, Yevgeny Primakov, appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, initiated the preparation of a document that could contain certain guarantees of the security of the Russian Federation in the process of the expansion of the Alliance. The result was the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between the Russian Federation and NATO (FA), signed in Paris on May 27, 1997.
                </p>

                <h3>Relations after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014</h3>
                <p>
                    Without a doubt, the crisis around Ukraine had the greatest impact on relations between Russia and NATO. Many politicians and experts in the West believed that the crisis began with the annexation of Crimea to Russia (which in the West is considered an "annexation", and in Russia, the restoration of historical justice and reunification). However, many Russian experts believe that the "break-up process" began with negotiations between Ukraine and the EU on granting Kyiv the status of "associate member" in NATO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On April 1, 2014, in response to Russia's actions in Crimea, NATO suspended all types of practical cooperation through the Russia-NATO Council, explaining its position by the fact that "business as before is impossible". The decisions of the Wales Summit (2014) showed that NATO had returned from the policy of repelling new threats to its roots - to ensuring collective defense.
                </p>

                <h2>Relations between Russia and NATO after the start of the special military operation in February 2022</h2>

                <h3>NATO's military potential on the border</h3>
                <p>
                    NATO's strategy towards the Baltic region has changed over the past few years, especially since February 2022, when a large-scale transformation of the European security system began. The growth of the share of the maritime component is becoming especially noticeable, US air bases are being strengthened, high priority is given to the use of high-precision weapons, air, surface and underwater UAVs at sea. Currently, about 85 thousand US troops are stationed at more than 40 bases in Europe - from Greenland to Poland and the Baltic states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Russian political observers have stated that NATO is preparing for a possible war with Russia in the Baltic region, citing a number of "obvious factors", in particular the expansion of the bloc to the Russian borders at the expense of Sweden and Finland in order to create additional tensions for Russia and the desire to turn the Baltic into an internal sea of the alliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the pretext of Russia's existential threat to all Baltic region countries, Poland is actively modernizing and transforming its armed forces, rapidly increasing the military potential of armored vehicles, artillery, ground, air and naval forces, purchasing modern weapons abroad in record volumes that exceed needs. Poland's ambitious plans to increase defense spending to 5% and create a combat-ready 300,000-strong army seem difficult to implement, since this will require colossal financial and economic resources.
                </p>

                <h3>The Russian side's response</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the Russian Ambassador to Stockholm Sergey Belyaev in an interview with the Izvestia news portal on July 8, 2025, the Baltic is an unconditional sphere of Russian interests, and the Russian Federation will actively resist Western attempts to block Russian Baltic ports, access to the sea from St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russia has also increased the deployment of advanced missile systems and air defense assets in the Kaliningrad region and other western areas, including Iskander-M tactical ballistic missiles, S-400 and S-500 air defense systems, and electronic warfare units. These are designed to counter NATO's growing precision strike capabilities and to secure control over the Baltic Sea region in the event of conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In response to the perceived threat from NATO's military infrastructure development, Russia has intensified snap military exercises and drills in its western military districts, often simulating large-scale mobilizations and counterattacks. Furthermore, Russia has reinforced its naval capabilities in the Baltic Fleet and conducted joint drills with Belarusian forces under the framework of the Union State.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The NATO-Russia relationship has undergone a profound transformation, shifting from cautious cooperation in the post-Cold War era to active deterrence and counter-deterrence. What once seemed like a potential strategic partnership in the 1990s has evolved into a new confrontation along NATO's eastern borders. The militarization of this frontier—fueled by mutual suspicion, expanding alliances, and unresolved security concerns—has created one of the most volatile and heavily armed regions in the world today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both NATO and Russia cite defense and deterrence as their guiding principles, yet their actions reflect deepening distrust and an increasing reliance on military solutions over diplomatic engagement. NATO's enhanced presence in the Baltics, the integration of Finland and Sweden, and growing calls for nuclear deployments are matched by Russia's strategic repositioning, infrastructure buildup, and doctrinal shift toward preemption and rapid mobilization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this context, the risks of unintended conflict or provocation are significantly elevated. The absence of meaningful dialogue mechanisms and the suspension of treaties that once served as stabilizers have left a dangerous vacuum. Without renewed diplomatic efforts and mutual confidence-building measures, the trajectory of NATO-Russia relations is likely to remain confrontational, with continued escalation posing a long-term threat to regional and global security.
                </p>

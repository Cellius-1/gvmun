                        <h4>Historical Context of NATO-Russia Relations</h4>
                        <h5>NATO-USSR Relations</h5>
                        <p>Relations between Russia and NATO have a long and complicated history, dating back to 1949, the year NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) was founded. This military-political alliance was created to protect European countries from a potential threat from the Soviet Union, which largely determined the nature of interaction between the parties for decades to come.</p>
                        
                        <p>During the Cold War, the USSR and NATO were in open conflict. Moscow, in opposition to the North Atlantic Alliance, created the Warsaw Pact on May 14, 1955, which united the countries of the socialist bloc into a military alliance. Meanwhile, NATO continued to expand: it was joined by West Germany, Greece, and Turkey in the 1960s.</p>
                        
                        <p>The period of détente began under Andrei Gromyko – a gradual easing of tensions between the USSR and the USA. The final stage of the détente policy was the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), held between July 3 and August 1, 1975 in Helsinki. The participants signed the Final Act, which guaranteed the recognition and inviolability of borders in Europe.</p>

                        <h4>NATO-Russia Relations in the 2000s</h4>
                        <p>After the collapse of the USSR on December 20, 1991, Russia became one of the founders of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), created as a platform for political dialogue between NATO and the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. After the end of the Cold War, NATO began to actively expand to the east, which led to the emergence of new "border" states of allies on Russia's borders.</p>
                        
                        <p>The result of negotiations was the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between the Russian Federation and NATO, signed in Paris on May 27, 1997. A fundamental point for Russia was that NATO confirmed the absence of intentions to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of its new members, as well as significant military forces on a permanent basis on the borders with Russia.</p>
                        
                        <p>Despite cooperation developments, there was one important aspect that marred these relations - the refusal of Western countries to ratify and implement the adapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Faced with the lack of reciprocal steps, Moscow declared a moratorium on fulfilling its obligations under the treaty in July 2007.</p>

                        <h4>Relations After Russia's Annexation of Crimea in 2014</h4>
                        <p>The crisis around Ukraine had the greatest impact on relations between Russia and NATO. On April 1, 2014, in response to Russia's actions in Crimea, NATO suspended all types of practical cooperation through the Russia-NATO Council, explaining its position by the fact that "business as before is impossible".</p>
                        
                        <p>The 2016 Warsaw summit demonstrated the readiness of transatlantic allies to symbolically strengthen their defense structures in the eastern direction in the form of four battalions of 1,000 men each. The Brussels summit approved the "4 by 30" initiative - 30 naval ships, 30 heavy and medium maneuver battalions, 30 combat armed squadrons that will be able to begin performing combat missions within 30 days.</p>
                        
                        <p>In mid-April 2019, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a decision to completely sever relations between Russia and NATO along military and civilian lines. The period 2020-2021 can be considered a time of increasing escalation in attempts at mutual containment, especially in the Baltic and Black Sea regions.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h4>NATO's Military Potential on the Border</h4>
                        <p>NATO's strategy towards the Baltic region has changed significantly since February 2022. Currently, about 85 thousand US troops are stationed at more than 40 bases in Europe - from Greenland to Poland and the Baltic states. NATO members explain their activity by the need to "contain" Russia, since it is strengthening its military potential in the Kaliningrad region.</p>
                        
                        <p>Poland is actively modernizing and transforming its armed forces, rapidly increasing military potential with ambitious plans to increase defense spending to 5% and create a combat-ready 300,000-strong army. Germany is also actively arming itself, particularly focusing on strengthening its air force with plans to acquire 70 additional Eurofighter aircraft, 35 F-35As and 60 CH-47F Chinook heavy transport helicopters.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Baltic countries are actively modernizing their post-Soviet infrastructure: airports, seaports, and railway connections. Estonia has stated readiness to accept NATO aircraft with nuclear weapons on board, while Lithuania will have about 5,000 Bundeswehr servicemen permanently stationed by 2025.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h4>The Russian Side's Response</h4>
                        <p>According to Russian officials, the Baltic is an unconditional sphere of Russian interests, and the Russian Federation will actively resist Western attempts to block Russian Baltic ports. Russia has strengthened the military group in the region after 2014, including the re-establishment of the Leningrad Military District and the formation of new army corps and divisions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Russia has increased the deployment of advanced missile systems and air defense assets in the Kaliningrad region, including Iskander-M tactical ballistic missiles, S-400 and S-500 air defense systems, and electronic warfare units. These are designed to counter NATO's growing precision strike capabilities and to secure control over the Baltic Sea region.</p>
                        
                        <p>Moscow has issued warnings regarding the deployment of Western nuclear capabilities in Eastern Europe. Russian officials have stated that the introduction of nuclear weapons systems into Poland or the Baltic states would trigger a "military-technical" response, potentially involving symmetrical deployments or targeting of host facilities.</p>

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>The NATO-Russia relationship has undergone a profound transformation, shifting from cautious cooperation in the post-Cold War era to active deterrence and counter-deterrence. What once seemed like a potential strategic partnership in the 1990s has evolved into a new confrontation along NATO's eastern borders.</p>
                        
                        <p>The militarization of this frontier—fueled by mutual suspicion, expanding alliances, and unresolved security concerns—has created one of the most volatile and heavily armed regions in the world today. Both NATO and Russia cite defense and deterrence as their guiding principles, yet their actions reflect deepening distrust and an increasing reliance on military solutions over diplomatic engagement.</p>
                        
                        <p>Without renewed diplomatic efforts and mutual confidence-building measures, the trajectory of NATO-Russia relations is likely to remain confrontational, with continued escalation posing a long-term threat to regional and global security.</p>

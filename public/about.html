                    <p>
                        Model United Nations, or MUN, is a simulation of the real UN for high school and college students. 
                        Delegates go to conferences, where they debate crucial global issues in committees, and collaborate 
                        to form resolutions - comprehensive solutions to these problems. It's a versatile platform that 
                        pairs talent with passion to spark real change.

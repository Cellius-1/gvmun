                    <p class="fade-in">Since January 2025, the Israeli occupation has intensified drone attacks, humanitarian blockade, and prevented Palestinians from accessing necessities such as aid, food, and water. Now, the North West Bank refugee camps in Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams have been forcibly displaced since the Israeli military launched its 'iron wall operation'.</p>

                        <h4>Military Operations and Infrastructure Destruction</h4>
                        <p>Israeli troops were deployed on rooftops with bulldozers, which were accompanied by heavy artillery, drones, and helicopters. There are dozens of schools, houses, and other buildings that were left in ruins. Drones are shown to have a huge role in the following attacks carried out by the IDF. This includes: the drone attack which occurred on the 22nd of August 2024, the death of 11 Palestinians on the 28th of August 2024.</p>
                        
                        <p>In early 2025, Israeli settlers have carried out 356 documented attacks, mainly targeting vulnerable communities. Additionally, more than 60 Palestinian communities have either been fully or partially displaced due to illegal outposts. Israeli demolitions have also been acting against militant flashpoints in the camp of Jenin.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Maghazi camp, which originally housed approximately 18,000 people, had also been similarly devastated. Many were forced to flee multiple times due to safe zones being shifted and Israeli drone attacks intensified.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h4>Historical Context and UN Concerns</h4>
                        <p>With the Palestinian war continuing, according to the UN, the mass displacement in the West Bank has been at its worst since Israel's occupation of Gaza in 1967. Furthermore, the UN raises concerns of potential ethnic cleansing within the region. According to the OHCHR, countless Palestinians have continued to face the continuous threat of forced displacement.</p>
                        
                        <p>On June 10, the Jerusalem municipality stated that demolition orders had been issued for the village of Nu'man, which is home to over 150 people. This had been done by cutting off the village from the West Bank via the construction of the separation wall, which incorporated the Israeli military. As for the villagers, they were not issued a 'Jerusalem identity card' and as a consequence, could not access any services within East Jerusalem and any parts of the West Bank.</p>

                        <h4>Escalating Humanitarian Crisis</h4>
                        <p>As the war between Palestine and Israel continues to escalate, the humanitarian crisis on the ground continues to increase, with one of the most alarming developments being the sharp rise of malnutrition, aid, and starvation amongst the Palestinian population, particularly in the Gaza Strip. With infrastructure continuing to be decimated, ongoing blockades, and vital services collapsing.</p>
                        
                        <p>The UN continues to press both Hamas and Israeli officials for immediate, safe, and immediate, and demilitarised access to ensure the safety of civilians, in addition to which all hostages who are held are to be immediately released.</p>

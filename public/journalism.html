                        <div class="article-excerpt">
                            <p>On January 20th, 2025, President-Elect Donald Trump will begin his historic second, non-consecutive term as the 47th President of the United States. His upset victory over Vice-President Kamala Harris has prompted global reactions and questions over the implications of a second Trump Administration on the global order.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="article-full-content" style="display: none;">
                            <div class="article-section">
                                <h4>Impact on the Global Economy</h4>
                                <p>Central to Trump's "America First" policy throughout the campaign trail has been his vow to slap a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, a 10%-20% universal tariff, and a 200% tariff on Mexican automobiles. Economists warn that this will increase domestic inflation and slow global trade. A trade war with China may resume, prompting China to dump its exports elsewhere like Europe (prompting a chain reaction of tariffs) and retaliate with high tariffs, disrupting global trade.</p>
                                
                                <p>Trump's plans to deport five million undocumented Mexican immigrants back to Mexico and impose tariffs on its automobile industry, can also damage the Mexican economy. Additionally, Trump threatens to withdraw from the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, further undermining regional trade alliances.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="article-section">
                                <h4>Trump's Foreign Policy</h4>
                                <p>Trump's distinctive foreign policy is characterized by skepticism and a "transactional" approach toward alliances. Trump's criticism of NATO and his policy of conditional support based on allies spending their 'fair share' for defense, concerns Europe. His vow to end the war in Ukraine quickly without specifying how, is also a point of concern, as a quick end—possibly with concessions to Russia such as Ukrainian territory —may embolden further Russian encroachment threatening NATO, and offer China a template to exert its expansionist ideas.</p>
                                
                                <p>In the Middle East, Trump must balance Israel, the Gulf States, and Iran. Trump's "maximum pressure" policy against Iran in his first term, which included withdrawing from the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions, may continue. However, a more aggressive Iran, funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthis in Yemen, may force the administration to rethink its approach. Trump's cordial ties with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Egypt whilst also being pro-Israel may continue, prompting efforts similar to the brokering of the Abraham Accords and further normalization of relations between Israel and Middle Eastern states.</p>
                                
                                <p>In Asia, Japan and South Korea will have to navigate strategically to counter China and North Korea. Japan's relationship with the US thrived during his first term thanks to then-PM Shinzo Abe's careful maneuvering and proactive strategic policies. However, the trajectory of this alliance under Trump will rely on the results of Japan's general election, scheduled to take place in February 2025. Trump's openness to engage with Kim Jong Un contrasts with South Korea's hardline policy against North Korea, specifically its nuclear program, raising questions about the future of the Korean Peninsula. U.S.-India relations are expected to remain cordial—even strengthened—as both countries aim to curb China's growing military and economic influence.</p>
                                
                                <p>Trump's well-known track record of anti-climate protection policies, including withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement in his first term, raises concerns that he may potentially do the same once again in his second term, as well as implement other detrimental policies, sidelining climate action in an already fragile global climate situation.</p>

                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>President-Elect Trump inherits a volatile world, rife with uncertainty, conflicts, and a slowing global economy. It remains to be seen what policies will be enacted in the coming four years, but what is certain is that Trump's policies will undoubtedly leave a mark on the world for decades to come, for better or for worse.</p>
